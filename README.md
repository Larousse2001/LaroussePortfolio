# Larousse Portfolio

Larousse Portfolio is a website built with React, ThreeJS, React Three Fiber, TailwindCSS, and Framer Motion. It showcases experiences and projects in a 3D graphics environment to bring the content to life. The website is hosted at the following link:

## Introduction

In this project, I have used the following technologies and libraries:

- ThreeJS: a powerful 3D graphics library for rendering and animating the 3D model
- React Three Fiber: a popular library for creating 3D graphics with ThreeJS in React
- TailwindCSS: a popular utility-first CSS styling framework
- Framer Motion: the most popular library used to bring your React website to life with animations

I have also implemented the following features:

- Loading, creating, and customizing stunning 3D models and geometries with various lights, as well as understanding the 3D world with a camera and positioning of an object in space.
- Making the code reusable and scalable using Higher Order Components (HOCs) and other industry-standard best practices.
- Implementing sending emails through a form on the website.
- Ensuring responsiveness across all devices and improving site performance using Suspense and Preload.
